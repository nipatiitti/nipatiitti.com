This CV was made using Next.js, Chakra-ui and styled-components. This project is good example of what my frontend code looks at it's (2022) peak-ish.

I'm not an UI/UX designer but I did try my best to make it look pretty.

#### Small things I'm proud of in this project:

-   The page is fully SSG and works without JS.
-   The bundle is also relativily small (<150kB).
-   The design is responsive and works on all screen sizes.
