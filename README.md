# Portfolio and CV source

Live [here](https://nipatiitti.com)

This portfolio was made using my own custom [React boilerplate](https://github.com/nipatiitti/React-boilerplate) and is a good example of what my code looks at its (as of 2020) peak.

I'm not an UI/UX designer but I did try my best to make it look pretty.

#### Small things I'm proud of in this project:

-   All the animations are super optimized (they don't trigger any unnecessary repaints -> Butter smooth 60fps even on older devices)
-   How well the site behaves on big and small screen and everything between. I used css grid and media queries for this.
